# Deep-Learning-in-Strain-Gradient-Theory

### This is a Physics Informed Neural Network model which works on the principles of Strain Gradient Theory to find the deflection in micro-cantilever beam. The predictions are not always consistent because at micro level, the calculations are not very precise.
